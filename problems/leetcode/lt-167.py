# 167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted

"""
Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, 
find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, 
where index1 must be less than index2.

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
